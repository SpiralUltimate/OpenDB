# OpenDB
This is a workaround/alternative to using curl for [ReplitDB][replitdb]  
Dont know what I mean? 
So if you use replit db for php you have probably been stuck using curl.  
Well not anymore just import this to your project and you will be able to easily use [ReplitDB][replitdb] for [PHP][php]  
Like a lot of other people if you are wondering how to import OpenDB [Click me](https://spiralultimate.github.io/OpenDB/htl.html)  

Warning: OpenDB will not work unless imported into a [Replit PHP project](https://replit.com/talk/learn/PHP-tutorial-No-1-Introduction/15442)
