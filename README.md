# OpenDB
This is a workaround/alternative to using curl for replitdb
Dont know what I mean? So if you use replit db for php you have probably been stuck using curl. Whel not anymore just import this to your project and you will be able to easily use replitdb for php
Warning: OpenDB will not work unless imported into a replit php project
